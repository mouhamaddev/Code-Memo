### Mentorship Notes

I believe mentorship is one of the biggest hacks most people overlook. Instead of figuring everything out the hard way, I’d rather learn from people who’ve already walked the path. That’s why I’m looking to take some coaching and mentorship sessions with more experienced engineers: to shorten the road, avoid mistakes, and grow faster.

#### Notes:

1. You don't get paid for writing code, you get paid for making technical decision.
2. Practice explaining complex things simply.
3. A product must solve a real business problem.
4. Study product-market fit and customer pain points.

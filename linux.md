# Linux: An Overview

## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Unlike proprietary operating systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is based on Unix-like principles and is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. It forms the foundation of various operating systems collectively known as Linux distributions, or "distros."

### Key Features of Linux:

- **Open Source**: The source code is freely available and can be modified by anyone.
- **Security**: Linux is known for its robust security features.
- **Stability and Performance**: Linux systems are highly stable and can run for extended periods without crashing.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for various environments, from desktops to servers and embedded systems.
- **Community Support**: Strong support from a large global community of developers and users.

## How Distributions (Distros) Work

A Linux distribution is an OS made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel, system libraries, and software applications. Each distro is adapted for different user needs and preferences, providing unique features, package management systems, and default configurations.

### Components of a Linux Distribution:

- **Linux Kernel**: The core of the OS that manages hardware resources.
- **GNU Tools and Libraries**: Essential system utilities and libraries that work with the kernel.
- **Package Manager**: Software that automates the installation, upgrading, configuration, and removal of programs. Examples include APT (Debian-based), YUM/DNF (Red Hat-based), and Pacman (Arch-based).
- **Desktop Environment**: The graphical user interface (GUI) users interact with, such as GNOME, KDE, or XFCE.
- **Applications**: Pre-installed software such as web browsers, office suites, and media players.

### Popular Linux Distributions:

- **Ubuntu**: User-friendly, based on Debian, suitable for beginners.
- **Fedora**: Cutting-edge features, sponsored by Red Hat, aimed at developers and system administrators.
- **Debian**: Known for its stability and vast software repository.
- **Arch Linux**: Rolling release model, minimalistic, and highly customizable.
- **CentOS**: Community-supported, derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, used in servers.
- **Linux Mint**: Based on Ubuntu, popular for its ease of use and pre-installed multimedia support.

## Essential Knowledge for Using Linux

### Basic Commands:

- **Navigation**: `ls` (list files), `cd` (change directory), `pwd` (print working directory)
- **File Operations**: `cp` (copy files), `mv` (move/rename files), `rm` (remove files)
- **System Info**: `uname -a` (system information), `df -h` (disk space usage), `top` (process monitoring)

### File Permissions:

- **Understanding Permissions**: `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute)
- **Changing Permissions**: `chmod` (change file mode bits), `chown` (change file owner)
- **Example**: `chmod 755 file.sh` (rwxr-xr-x), `chown user:group file.sh`

### Shell Scripting:

- **Basics**: Writing and executing simple scripts with `#!/bin/bash` at the start.
- **Variables and Loops**: Using variables (`$VAR`), loops (`for`, `while`), and conditionals (`if`, `else`).
- **Example Script**:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  for i in {1..5}; do
      echo "Iteration $i"
  done
  ```

### System Administration:

- **User Management**: `adduser`, `deluser`, `usermod`
- **Service Management**: `systemctl start <service>`, `systemctl stop <service>`, `systemctl enable <service>`

# Understanding Kernels, Bootloaders, and GRUB

## The Kernel

### What is the Kernel?

The kernel is the core component of an operating system, acting as a bridge between the hardware and software. It manages system resources and allows applications to interact with hardware components such as the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices.

### Functions of the Kernel:

- **Process Management**: Controls processes, including scheduling, creation, and termination.
- **Memory Management**: Manages memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring efficient use of RAM.
- **Device Management**: Manages communication between hardware devices and software.
- **File System Management**: Handles file operations and manages file system access.
- **System Calls**: Provides an interface for applications to request services from the kernel.

### Types of Kernels:

- **Monolithic Kernels**: All essential operating system services run in the kernel space, leading to efficient performance. Examples: Linux, Unix.
- **Microkernels**: Only the most fundamental services run in kernel space, with other services running in user space. This design improves modularity and stability. Example: Minix, QNX.
- **Hybrid Kernels**: Combine elements of monolithic and microkernel designs. Example: Windows NT.

### The Linux Kernel:

The Linux kernel, initially released by Linus Torvalds in 1991, is a monolithic kernel used in various Linux distributions. It is open-source, highly configurable, and supports a wide range of hardware platforms.

## The Boot Process

The boot process is the sequence of events that occurs when a computer is powered on and the operating system is loaded into memory. Hereâ€™s an overview of the stages in the boot process:

1. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**:

   - The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) initializes hardware components and performs a Power-On Self Test (POST) to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
   - BIOS/UEFI locates and executes the bootloader from the bootable device (e.g., HDD, SSD).

2. **Bootloader Execution**:

   - The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system kernel into memory.
   - Common bootloaders include GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) and LILO (Linux Loader).

3. **Kernel Loading**:

   - The bootloader loads the kernel and initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs) into memory.
   - The kernel initializes hardware components, mounts the root file system, and starts the initial process (`init` or `systemd`).

4. **System Initialization**:
   - The `init` process or `systemd` initializes user-space services and sets up the user environment.
   - The system reaches a state where users can log in and interact with the OS.

## The Bootloader

### What is a Bootloader?

A bootloader is a program that loads the operating system kernel into memory and starts its execution. It also allows users to select from multiple operating systems installed on the system.

### Common Bootloaders:

- **GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)**: The most widely used bootloader for Linux systems, supporting a wide range of file systems and configurations.
- **LILO (Linux Loader)**: An older bootloader that has largely been replaced by GRUB.
- **Syslinux/EXTlinux**: Lightweight bootloaders often used for live USBs and embedded systems.

### Bootloader Stages:

1. **Stage 1**: Located in the Master Boot Record (MBR) or the GUID Partition Table (GPT). It loads the Stage 1.5 or Stage 2 bootloader.
2. **Stage 1.5**: Optional intermediate stage that understands file systems, allowing the Stage 2 bootloader to be located and loaded.
3. **Stage 2**: The main bootloader that presents the user with a menu to select the operating system and loads the selected OS kernel.

## GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)

### What is GRUB?

GRUB is the default bootloader for many Linux distributions. It is highly configurable and supports multiple operating systems, file systems, and advanced features like scripting and network booting.

### GRUB Versions:

- **GRUB Legacy**: The original version, now largely replaced by GRUB 2.
- **GRUB 2**: The current version with improved features, modular design, and better support for modern hardware.

### GRUB Configuration:

- **Configuration File**: `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`
- **Default File**: `/etc/default/grub` (used to generate `grub.cfg`)

### Key GRUB Commands:

- **Update GRUB Configuration**:
  ```sh
  sudo update-grub   # Debian-based systems
  sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg  # Other systems
  ```
- **Install GRUB**:
  ```sh
  sudo grub-install /dev/sdX  # Replace X with the appropriate drive letter
  ```

### GRUB Configuration Example:

```sh
# /etc/default/grub
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""

# /boot/grub/grub.cfg (generated)
menuentry 'Ubuntu' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
    recordfail
    load_video
    gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode
    insmod gzio
    insmod part_msdos
    insmod ext2
    set root='hd0,msdos1'
    linux /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-42-generic root=UUID=xxxx ro quiet splash
    initrd /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-42-generic
}
```

## Advanced Bootloader Concepts

### Chainloading:

Chainloading allows one bootloader to load another bootloader. This is useful for systems with multiple operating systems that each have their own bootloaders.

```sh
menuentry "Chainload Another GRUB" {
    set root=(hd0,1)
    chainloader +1
}
```

### Rescue Mode:

If GRUB fails to boot, it enters rescue mode, allowing users to manually boot the system or repair the bootloader.

- **Example Commands**:
  ```sh
  set root=(hd0,1)
  linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1
  initrd /boot/initrd.img
  boot
  ```

# Understanding the Linux File System Architecture

## The Linux File System Hierarchy

The Linux file system is structured in a hierarchical format, starting from the root directory `/` and branching into subdirectories. Each directory has a specific purpose, and understanding these can help you navigate and manage a Linux system more effectively.

### Root Directory `/`

The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux file system hierarchy. All other directories and files are nested within this root directory.

## Key Directories Under `/`

### `/bin` - Essential User Binaries

Contains essential command binaries (executables) needed for single-user mode and for all users. These commands are required for the system to boot and function correctly.

- Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `bash`

### `/sbin` - System Binaries

Holds essential system binaries that are typically used by the system administrator. These binaries are crucial for system maintenance and repair.

- Examples: `fsck`, `reboot`, `shutdown`, `ifconfig`

### `/etc` - Configuration Files

Contains all the system-wide configuration files and shell scripts that are used to boot and initialize system settings.

- Examples: `/etc/passwd` (user account information), `/etc/fstab` (file system mount points), `/etc/hosts` (hostname to IP mappings)

### `/home` - User Home Directories

Holds the home directories of all users. Each user has a subdirectory under `/home` where their personal files, configurations, and settings are stored.

- Example: `/home/username` (home directory for the user `username`)

### `/root` - Root User's Home Directory

The home directory of the root user (the superuser). It is separate from the `/home` directory to ensure the root user's files are isolated for security and system integrity.

- Example: `/root`

### `/lib` - Essential Shared Libraries

Contains essential shared libraries and kernel modules required for the binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

- Examples: `libc.so`, `libdl.so`

### `/usr` - User Binaries and Read-Only Data

Stands for "Unix System Resources" and contains user utilities and applications. This directory is further subdivided to organize its contents.

- **`/usr/bin`**: Non-essential command binaries for all users (e.g., `gcc`, `make`)
- **`/usr/sbin`**: Non-essential system binaries for the superuser (e.g., `apache2`, `vsftpd`)
- **`/usr/lib`**: Libraries for `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`
- **`/usr/share`**: Architecture-independent data (e.g., documentation, icons, default configurations)

### `/var` - Variable Files

Contains variable data files. This includes files that are expected to grow over time, such as logs, databases, cache, and spool files.

- **`/var/log`**: Log files (e.g., `syslog`, `dmesg`)
- **`/var/spool`**: Spool directories for tasks like printing and mail
- **`/var/tmp`**: Temporary files preserved between reboots

### `/tmp` - Temporary Files

Holds temporary files created by system and user processes. Files in `/tmp` are often deleted on system reboot.

- Example: Temporary storage for downloads and installations

### `/dev` - Device Files

Contains device files that represent hardware devices. These are special files that allow software to interact with hardware devices like disks, terminals, and printers.

- Examples: `/dev/sda` (first hard drive), `/dev/tty` (terminals), `/dev/null` (null device)

### `/mnt` - Mount Directory

A generic mount point under which temporary file systems can be mounted. Often used for mounting external storage devices like USB drives.

- Example: `/mnt/usb`

### `/media` - Removable Media

Contains subdirectories for mounting removable media such as USB drives, CD-ROMs, and DVDs.

- Example: `/media/cdrom`

### `/opt` - Optional Packages

Used for installing additional software packages that are not part of the default Linux distribution. Often contains commercial software.

- Example: `/opt/mysoftware`

### `/srv` - Service Data

Holds data for services provided by the system, such as web and FTP servers.

- Examples: `/srv/www` (web server data), `/srv/ftp` (FTP server data)

### `/proc` - Process Information

A virtual file system that provides a mechanism to access process information and kernel information. It contains a hierarchy of special files representing the current state of the kernel.

- Examples: `/proc/cpuinfo` (CPU information), `/proc/meminfo` (memory information)

### `/sys` - System Information

Another virtual file system similar to `/proc` that exposes information about the system and allows interaction with the kernel.

- Examples: `/sys/class` (device classes), `/sys/block` (block devices)

### `/run` - Runtime Data

Contains transient runtime data since the last boot. It is used for storing data that should not persist across reboots.

- Examples: `/run/lock` (lock files), `/run/user` (user-specific runtime data)

### `/boot` - Boot Loader Files

Contains files related to the boot loader and kernel. These are essential for the system to boot.

- Examples: `vmlinuz` (kernel image), `initrd.img` (initial RAM disk)

### `/lost+found` - Recovered Files

A directory used by the `fsck` (file system check) utility for recovering lost files. It exists on every partition with a file system.

- Example: `/lost+found` (contains recovered file fragments)

## Understanding How It All Works Together

The Linux file system hierarchy is designed to keep the system organized and efficient. Each directory has a specific role, ensuring that files are systematically categorized based on their function and usage. This structure allows users and system administrators to easily locate and manage files and ensures that the operating system operates smoothly.

- **System Binaries and Libraries**: Core system binaries and libraries are placed in `/bin`, `/sbin`, and `/lib` to ensure they are available during the boot process and in single-user mode.
- **User Data**: User-specific files and configurations are stored in `/home`, ensuring each user's data is isolated and protected.
- **Configuration and Logs**: System-wide configuration files in `/etc` and logs in `/var/log` help manage and troubleshoot the system effectively.
- **Device Management**: The `/dev` and `/sys` directories provide an interface to hardware devices, allowing the kernel and user space programs to interact with the hardware.
- **Temporary and Variable Data**: Temporary files in `/tmp` and variable data in `/var` ensure that transient and growing data is separated from static system files.

Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for effective system administration, troubleshooting, and maintaining a Linux system.

   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**
   ```shell
   docker --version
   ```

## Basic Docker Commands

- **Pull an image from Docker Hub:**

  ```shell
  docker pull <image_name>
  ```

  Example:

  ```shell
  docker pull nginx
  ```

- **Run a container:**

  ```shell
  docker run -d -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
  ```

  Example:

  ```shell
  docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
  ```

- **List running containers:**

  ```shell
  docker ps
  ```

- **Stop a running container:**

  ```shell
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```

- **Remove a container:**

  ```shell
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

- **List all images:**

  ```

## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.

### Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Building and Running a Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```shell
   docker build -t <your_image_name> .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```shell
   docker run -p 4000:80 <your_image_name>
   ```

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: my_web_app
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

### Using Docker Compose

1. **Start the application:**

   ```shell
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Stop the application:**
   ```shell
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Advanced Docker Concepts

### Networking

- **Creating a network:**

  ```shell
  docker network create <network_name>
  ```

- **Connecting a container to a network:**
  ```shell
  docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>
  ```

### Volumes

- **Creating a volume:**

  ```shell
  docker volume create <volume_name>
  ```

- **Mounting a volume to a container:**
  ```shell
  docker run -d -v <volume_name>:/path/in/container <image_name>
  ```

### Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers.

- **Initialize a Swarm:**

  ```shell
  docker swarm init
  ```

- **Deploy a stack:**
  ```shell
  docker stack deploy -c <compose-file> <stack_name>
  ```

# How To Set Up Django with Postgres, Nginx, and Gunicorn on Ubuntu

Check out the [full tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu).

This guide details the process of setting up a Django application with PostgreSQL, Nginx, and Gunicorn on Ubuntu 22.04. It covers installing necessary packages, configuring PostgreSQL, setting up Django, and configuring Gunicorn and Nginx for production deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Server running Ubuntu with a non-root user with sudo privileges and an active firewall.
- Upgrade to a supported Ubuntu version if using 16.04 or below.

## Steps to Setup Django, Nginx & Gunicorn

### Step 1 â€” Install Packages from the Ubuntu Repositories

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib nginx curl
```

### Step 2 â€” Create the PostgreSQL Database and User

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE myproject;
CREATE USER myprojectuser WITH PASSWORD 'password';
ALTER ROLE myprojectuser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE myprojectuser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE myprojectuser SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE myproject TO myprojectuser;
\q
```

### Step 3 â€” Create a Python Virtual Environment for Your Project

```bash
mkdir ~/myprojectdir
cd ~/myprojectdir
python3 -m venv myprojectenv
source myprojectenv/bin/activate
pip install django gunicorn psycopg2-binary
```

### Step 4 â€” Create and Configure a New Django Project

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject ~/myprojectdir
nano ~/myprojectdir/myproject/settings.py
```

- Modify `ALLOWED_HOSTS`:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_server_domain_or_IP', 'second_domain_or_IP', 'localhost']
```

- Update `DATABASES`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'myproject',
        'USER': 'myprojectuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}
```

- Set `STATIC_ROOT`:

```python
import os
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/')
```

### Step 5 â€” Complete Initial Project Setup

```bash
~/myprojectdir/manage.py makemigrations
~/myprojectdir/manage.py migrate
~/myprojectdir/manage.py createsuperuser
~/myprojectdir/manage.py collectstatic
sudo ufw allow 8000
~/myprojectdir/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Step 6 â€” Test Gunicornâ€™s Ability to Serve the Project

```bash
cd ~/myprojectdir
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myproject.wsgi
deactivate
```

### Step 7 â€” Create systemd Socket and Service Files for Gunicorn

- Create Gunicorn socket file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket
```

Add:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

- Create Gunicorn service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
```

Add:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
Requires=gunicorn.socket
After=network.target

[Service]
User=sammy
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/sammy/myprojectdir
ExecStart=/home/sammy/myprojectdir/myprojectenv/bin/gunicorn \
          --access-logfile - \
          --workers 3 \
          --bind unix:/run/gunicorn.sock \
          myproject.wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket
```

### Step 8 â€” Check for the Gunicorn Socket File

```bash
sudo systemctl status gunicorn.socket
file /run/gunicorn.sock
sudo journalctl -u gunicorn.socket
```

### Step 9 â€” Test Socket Activation

```bash
curl --unix-socket /run/gunicorn.sock localhost
sudo systemctl status gunicorn
sudo journalctl -u gunicorn
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
```

### Step 10 â€” Configure Nginx to Proxy Pass to Gunicorn

- Create Nginx server block:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject
```

Add:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name server_domain_or_IP;

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        root /home/sammy/myprojectdir;
    }

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;
    }
}
```

- Enable the Nginx server block:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo ufw delete allow 8000
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

By following these steps, you will have a fully functional Django application served with PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, and Nginx on Ubuntu.

### How to Build and Run a `.sh` Script in Linux

#### Step 1: Create the Script File

1. **Open a Terminal:**

   - You can open a terminal window on most Linux distributions by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T`.

2. **Create a New File:**
   - You can use a text editor like `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit` to create a new script file. For example, using `nano`:
     ```sh
     nano script.sh
     ```

#### Step 2: Write the Script

1. **Add the Shebang Line:**

   - At the top of your script, add the shebang line to specify the script should be run with `bash`:
     ```sh
     #!/bin/bash
     ```

2. **Add Your Commands:**

   - Write the commands you want your script to execute. For example:

     ```sh
     #!/bin/bash

     echo "Hello, World!"
     ls -l
     ```

3. **Save and Exit:**
   - Save the file and exit the text editor. In `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`.

#### Step 3: Make the Script Executable

1. **Change the Permissions:**
   - You need to give execution permission to your script file. Use the `chmod` command:
     ```sh
     chmod +x script.sh
     ```

#### Step 4: Run the Script

1. **Execute the Script:**
   - You can run your script by typing:
     ```sh
     ./script.sh
     ```

### Managing Permissions with `chmod`

```sh
chmod [options] mode file
```

### Recursive Changes

To change permissions recursively, meaning applying the changes to all files and directories within a specified directory, you can use the `-R` (or `--recursive`) option. Here are examples of how to use this:

- **Example 1:** Change permissions of all files and directories within `/www/store` to `777`:

  ```sh
  chmod -R 777 /www/store
  ```

  This command sets the permissions for all files and directories within `/www/store` to `777`, which means that everyone can read, write, and execute.

- **Example 2:** Change permissions of all files and directories in the current directory to `777`:

  ```sh
  chmod -R 777 ./
  ```

  This command applies the same permissions to everything in the current directory.

### Permissions in Linux

File permissions in Unix and Linux are represented by a three-digit octal number. Each digit can be a value from 0 to 7, representing different levels of permission. The three digits are assigned to:

1. **User (Owner)**
2. **Group**
3. **Others**

Each digit is a sum of the following values:

| Number | Permission    | Symbol |
| ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| 0      | No Permission | ---    |
| 1      | Execute       | --x    |
| 2      | Write         | -w-    |
| 4      | Read          | r--    |

These values can be combined to form other permissions:

| Number | Permission           | Symbol |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------ |
| 3      | Write and Execute    | -wx    |
| 5      | Read and Execute     | r-x    |
| 6      | Read and Write       | rw-    |
| 7      | Read, Write, Execute | rwx    |

### Examples

- **777**: Read, write, and execute permissions for user, group, and others.

  ```sh
  chmod 777 filename
  ```

  Permissions: `rwxrwxrwx`

- **755**: Read, write, and execute permissions for user; read and execute permissions for group and others.

  ```sh
  chmod 755 filename
  ```

  Permissions: `rwxr-xr-x`

- **644**: Read and write permissions for user; read-only permissions for group and others.

  ```sh
  chmod 644 filename
  ```

  Permissions: `rw-r--r--`

### Permissions Table

| Number | User (Owner)         | Group                | Others               | Symbol |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| 0      | No Permission        | No Permission        | No Permission        | ---    |
| 1      | Execute              | Execute              | Execute              | --x    |
| 2      | Write                | Write                | Write                | -w-    |
| 3      | Write and Execute    | Write and Execute    | Write and Execute    | -wx    |
| 4      | Read                 | Read                 | Read                 | r--    |
| 5      | Read and Execute     | Read and Execute     | Read and Execute     | r-x    |
| 6      | Read and Write       | Read and Write       | Read and Write       | rw-    |
| 7      | Read, Write, Execute | Read, Write, Execute | Read, Write, Execute | rwx    |

# Random Notes

Some of these random notes might not be Linux related.

```

## Fixing Django Cannot Connect to MySQL

1. Check MySQL Service

```sh
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

2. Allow MySQL Port Through Firewall

```sh
sudo ufw allow 3306
```

3. Configure MySQL

Edit the MySQL configuration file `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` to ensure it accepts connections:

Configuration Steps:

- Ensure the port is set to 3306:
  ```ini
  port = 3306
  ```
- Adjust the `bind-address` setting:
  - To accept connections from localhost:
    ```ini
    bind-address = 127.0.0.1
    ```
  - To accept remote connections, you might set it to `0.0.0.0` or your serverâ€™s specific IP address:
    ```ini
    bind-address = 0.0.0.0
    ```

4. Check Network

Ensure that the network is working correctly:

```sh
ping localhost
```

5. Create MySQL User and Grant Permissions

Create a MySQL user, grant necessary permissions, and allow connections from the backend server's IP address:

Steps to Create a MySQL User and Grant Permissions:

1. Log in to MySQL as the root user:

   ```sh
   sudo mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. Create a new user and grant privileges:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'django_user'@'backend_server_ip' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database.* TO 'django_user'@'backend_server_ip';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

Example Commands:

- Create a user:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'django_user'@'backend_server_ip' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';
  ```

- Grant all privileges to the user on a specific database:

  ```sql
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database.* TO 'django_user'@'backend_server_ip';
  ```

- Apply the changes:
  ```sql
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```

## Reverse Proxy

- **Reverse Proxy**:
  - Sits between client devices and a web server.
  - Intercepts requests from clients and forwards them to the web server.
  - Benefits include:
    - Load balancing.
    - Enhanced security (hides the identity and characteristics of the backend server).
    - SSL termination (handles SSL encryption/decryption to reduce the load on backend servers).
    - Caching (improves performance by serving cached content for repeated requests).

## Load Balancer

- **Load Balancer**:
  - Distributes incoming network or application traffic across multiple servers.

## Scaling

- **Vertical Scaling**:

  - Involves adding more CPU and RAM to a single server.

- **Horizontal Scaling**:
  - Involves adding more servers and using a load balancer to distribute the load.

I’m 21 years old, graduated recently with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science.

I started coding in 2017 and was into game development.

From 2023 to mid-2024, during my first year of university, I landed my first hybrid job at a local e-commerce company. I managed to balance both work and studies. The money wasn’t great, but the experience was absolutely worth it.

In the past 10 months, I’ve been working with a great team on an internal system for a large technician-based company based in the US.

In the long term, I see myself leading teams and engineering solutions.

I'm currently seeking mentorship because I believe it's one of the most effective ways to advance growth and avoid mistakes by learning from someone who's already walked the path.

<br>

<b>Ways a mentor could guide me</b>

1. What would your learning roadmap look like for the next 6–12 months if you were in my position?
2. What’s one mistake people at my position usually make that I should avoid?
3. If you were a hiring manager at a top-tier company, would you consider me for an engineering role? If not, what do you think is missing?

Also would be great to have feedback in:

1. Profiles ([GitHub](https://github.com/mouhamaddev/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mouhamaddev/)..).
2. My [Resume](https://mouhamaddev.github.io/mouhamaddev/).
3. [Django async framework](https://github.com/mouhamaddev/django-async-framework) (Python library)
4. Personal knowledge base: [Code Memo](https://mouhamaddev.github.io/Code-Memo/).

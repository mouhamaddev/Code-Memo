I’m 21 years old, graduated recently with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science.

I wrote my first line of code in 2017 when I was around 13 years old. I started with Python’s `turtle` library, just telling a cursor to move up, down, left, right to draw shapes.

From 2017 to 2022, I was into game development. I worked with a team of three on game jams. I also explored many other technologies like Java (Android Studio), C# desktop apps, Raw PHP, Firebase (especially Firestore when it came out), Kotlin, Angular, and Linux (was obsessed with arch).

From 2023 to mid-2024, during my first year of university, I landed my first hybrid job at a local e-commerce company. I managed to balance both work and studies. The money wasn’t great, but the experience was absolutely worth it. I handled backend development, deployments, db management, server admin tasks, system architecture..

Current Role:
In the past 10 months, I’ve been working with a great team on an internal system for a large technician-based company based in the US. The pay is better, though I still think there’s more potential to grow, not out of greed, but ambition.

<b>Why am I here?</b>
I’m currently seeking mentorship because I’m competitive, not in a toxic way, just deeply driven. I also want to enjoy the journey, and I do.

Mainly, I'm doing two things right now:
1. Building and maintaining [Django async framework](https://github.com/mouhamaddev/django-async-framework) (Python library)
2. Maintaining [Code Memo](https://mouhamaddev.github.io/Code-Memo/).

Goals:
1. I want to make an exponential leap in my career.
2. I want to move toward FAANG and top-tier companies.
3. Long-term, I see myself leading teams and engineering solutions.

<br>

<b>Ways a mentor could guide me</b>
1. If you were 21 again with my background, what would you focus on next?
2. What’s one mistake people at my stage usually make that I should avoid?
3. How would you approach preparing for top-tier companies starting from my level?
4. What would your learning roadmap look like for the next 6–12 months in my position?
5. Is there something I’m not seeing that I should be focusing on?

<br>

And finally, the big one:
If you were a hiring manager at a top-tier company, would you consider me for a serious engineering role? If not, what do you think is missing?

<br>

Also would be great to have:
1. Profiles feedback ([GitHub](https://github.com/mouhamaddev/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mouhamaddev/)..).
2. [Resume](https://mouhamaddev.github.io/mouhamaddev/) breakdown.

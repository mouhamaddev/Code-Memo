## LeetCode Problems

Some people focus on memorizing various algorithms, which can be beneficial at times but may also can be harmful to their problem-solving skills. Others rely only on problem-solving and might spend 10 hours on a single problem without finding a solution.

The most effective approach to solving coding problems combines both problem-solving skills and algorithm memorization. Instead of memorizing the exact code, you should be prepared to write any algorithm as needed. In other words, problem-solving is about recognizing patterns and knowing which algorithm to apply and implement.

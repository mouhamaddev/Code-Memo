## Interview Preparation

<i>The Scariest Thing Ever :D</i>

Honestly I wasn’t planning to share these interview prep notes at first. I felt like it's something I’d keep to myself. But since Code-Memo already covers most of the stuff I’m specializing in, and interviews are a big part of that right now, I figured I’d add them here too hoping they’ll help someone else on a similar journey.

<br>

Randoms:
One thing I’ve been really focused on lately is finding strong mentors, people who’ve been at top-tier companies and really know how to build world-class systems.
When it comes to setting goals, I’m a big believer in aiming high, even if I don’t hit 100%, the progress I make will still be way beyond average. For example, in my daily to-do list, I’ll put down 10 to 12 tasks knowing I probably won’t finish them all, but getting 7 or 8 done already feels like a win.
So for the future, I’m aiming big, I want to grow my leadership skills to eventually become a technical leader, maybe a CTO. So I’m looking for a place where I can learn from great engineers while building real impact.
Would love to be part of the core engineering team and a founder software engineer.

Basic manners:
How are you? > I’m doing well, thanks! Hope you’re doing great too. / All good, thanks!
Do you know x? > Let me take a second to think about that. / I’m not sure, but I’d love to learn more about it.
If you don’t understand a question during an interview > I’m sorry, could you please clarify or rephrase the question?
It was great meeting you > Likewise! thanks a lot!
Do you have any questions for us? > Yes actually.. Thanks for answering
It was a pleasure meeting with you.
Thanks again for your time

Just a quick heads-up, English isn’t my first language, but I’m actively working on improving it and will do my best to clearly express my thoughts.
Another question, is it fine to take notes while doing this meeting if I wanted to remember something for later?

Salary Negotiation:
Is the compensation aligned with a global market standard or localized based on geography?
Do you offer equity as part of the overall package?
Based on my current skills and long-term potential, I’m aiming for a total compensation in the range of $2,300 to $2,700 USD per month, with equity considered depending on the company’s stage and team structure.

1. Personal Introduction & Background

Tell me about yourself
> Sure. My name is Mohammad, I'm a software engineer, based in Lebanon, with a strong focus on backend development. Over the past few years, I’ve worked with both cross-functional and siloed teams to build and scale backend systems especially using technologies like Django and DRF.
> TODO: Talk about me dedicating most of my free time maintaining my OSS.

Tell me about your background
> I come from a computer science and software engineering background, with the last few years primarily focused on backend development. I’ve worked in both large environments and small teams, where i took full ownership of designing and building scalable APIs and backend services.

Do you have any experience with AI or LLM?
> Earlier in my career, I was diving in the world of machine learning, but over time, I realized that I’m more passionate about software architecture and management than the day-to-day ML modeling, though I still love machine learning—especially computer vision. I’ve worked on personal projects ranging from the classical prediction and classification problems in jupiter notebook to my more complex little personal research about  developing a self-balancing drone using infrared LEDs versus AprilTags for indoor positioning, where the drone can return to its original spot even after being moved manually.

Tell me about your latest positions
> My first role was at a local e-commerce company called waffershop, where I developed the backend and APIs for both their website and mobile app using Django and Django REST Framework. After about 1 and a half year, I moved to my current position, where I’ve been for the past 11 months. I work with a large US-based company called AGI, specifically on a tenant named AGParts Worldwide. My responsibility is maintaining and improving their management system that they use to manage their technical services.

What’s something you're proud of that’s not on your resume?
> One thing I’m proud of that’s not on my resume is my role as a leader of a scout troop. I manage a group of 60 children along with two assistant leaders, organizing and leading various activities.

What are you most proud of professionally?
> Professionally, I’m most proud of owning and scaling backend systems that directly support complex workflows and improve user experience. At AGParts Worldwide, I maintained and enhanced a management system used by technicians. I was trusted to take ownership of critical components and successfully delivering improvements that help the team work more efficiently is something I take great pride in.

What’s your favorite tech stack and why?
> My favorite tech stack Python with Django and Django REST Framework for backend development. I like it because it has a great balance between productivity and scalability. Django’s “batteries included” philosophy gives a solid and secure foundation out of the box which helps build clean, maintainable APIs quickly. Coupled with PostgreSQL for a reliable relational database and Docker for consistent deployments.

What are you working on right now (personal projects)?
> Right now, I’m working on a couple of personal projects to deepen my skills, One is called “code-memo” where I write personal notes about every litte detail i learn, including topics like python, django, software engineering and architecture, and im working on rewriting Django documentation in my own words. I’m also developing DAF, an open-source asynchronous framework built on top of Django to make async programming easier and more accessible in Django projects.

Any person you like?
> One person I really admire is Tom Christie. He’s been a major inspiration to me, especially because of his work on the Django REST Framework, which has fundamentally changed how APIs are built in the Django community.

Do you have any hobbies?
> Outside of tech, I’m also a professional freediver, it's a discipline that’s taught me a lot about patience, and managing pressure, which helps staying calm and deliberate when solving complex real world problems.

2. Motivation, Goals & Passion

What motivates you?
> What motivates me most is solving real problems and seeing my work make a meaningful impact.

What are you passionate about building?
> I’m passionate about building clean, scalable backend systems that solve real-world problems. I enjoy designing APIs, structuring databases, and thinking about system architecture that can grow over time without becoming a mess.

What are your long-term goals?
> Long-term, I want to grow into a leadership role where I’m responsible for designing the architecture of large-scale systems and mentoring other engineers.

Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?
> In 3 to 5 years, I see myself as a senior or lead backend engineer, deeply involved in designing scalable systems and making high-level architectural decisions. Long term, I’d love to be part of a team where innovation, ownership, and impact are part of the everyday culture.

What’s something technical you want to learn this year?
> This year, I’m focusing on deepening my understanding of asynchronous programming in Python, especially within the Django ecosystem. I’ve already started exploring it through a personal project where I’m building an async framework on top of Django, and I am working on pushing it further.

Do you want to become a team lead / manager / CTO eventually?
> Yes, I’m definitely looking for a leadership role like team lead or manager eventually, since I see myself having the right skills for a management role.

What excites you about this opportunity?
> What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to work at the intersection of backend engineering and AI technology. I’m really motivated by the idea of contributing to a fast-growing startup where I can have a direct impact on the product and help shape the architecture from early stages.

3. Work Preferences & Availability

What’s your availability? / How soon could you start if we made an offer?
> I’m availability / able to start as soon as needed, but I’m happy to provide a standard two-week notice to my current employer to ensure a smooth transition. If there’s an urgent need, I can discuss options to accommodate an earlier start.

Are you okay working remotely?
> Yes, I’m completely comfortable working remotely. In fact, I’ve been doing so in my current role, and I beleive with right communication and time management, remote position is way more productive (at least for me).

4. Why This Company / Role

Why do you want to work here?
> I appreciate how [Company Name] combines innovation with real-world applications, and I want to be part of a team that’s building solutions that can make impact. Additionally, I would love to contribute directly to the product and architecture from an early stage.

What interests you about our product/team?
> 
> Being part of a company at this stage — where there’s still room to shape both product and engineering culture — is something I’d love.

what would your presence help [Company Name] with?
What do you know about our company?
What excites you about joining at an early stage?
Why do you want to work at a startup instead of a big company?
What do you want from your next role?
What kind of company or environment do you thrive in?

5. Team Collaboration & Communication

How do you give and receive feedback?
> I believe feedback is one of the most important way for growth. When giving feedback, I focus on being constructive. When receiving feedback, I approach it with curiosity and openness because even if it’s tough to hear, I see it as a chance to improve. I’d much rather hear honest feedback than stay in the dark about areas I can grow in.

How do you manage conflicting opinions?
> When conflicting opinions come up, I try to approach them with a mindset of understanding rather than defending. I’ve found that when you keep the discussion grounded in the outcome we’re all aiming for, it becomes easier to find common ground or a compromise.

Tell me about a time you disagreed with a teammate — how did you handle it?
> At AGParts Worldwide, we were working on an internal grading system for technicians. A teammate suggested we store some temporary grading data in the database without proper model validation, to speed up delivery for a deadline. I disagreed because I knew skipping validation might lead to data integrity issues down the line—especially since this data would eventually be used in reports and dashboards. Rather than saying no outright, I asked if we could walk through the edge cases together. I showed how a few small changes—like using Django model forms or serializers even for temp data—could help us stay safe without losing much time.

How do you handle remote async communication?
> I handle remote async communication by making sure to write detailed messages that include all necessary context, so teammates don’t have to ask follow-up questions just to understand what I’m saying. I’ve worked with distributed teams before, so I’ve learned that async only works well when you over-communicate thoughtfully and treat documentation as a core part of the work.

6. Strengths, Weaknesses & Self-Assessment

What are your biggest strengths?
> Besides technical skills like backend development and database design, I’m good at problem-solving under pressure and adapting quickly to changing requirements. I’m also highly self-motivated and take initiative to improve processes and code quality without waiting for direction.

What’s your biggest weakness?
> I used to struggle with saying "no" or pushing back when workloads got heavy, which sometimes led to taking on too much at once. I’ve been working on setting clearer boundaries and communicating priorities proactively, so I can maintain quality and avoid burnout.

What’s something you’re still working on?
> I’m continuously working on improving my front-end knowledge so I can better understand the full stack and contribute more holistically in projects.

How would your coworkers describe you?
> They’d probably say I’m reliable and detail-oriented.

7. Problem Solving & Learning

Talk about a problem you faced and how you approached it?
> At AGParts Worldwide, we had a legacy API that was slowing down due to inefficient queries and poor database indexing. I first analyzed the bottlenecks using profiling tools and logs, then refactored the queries and added appropriate indexes.

Tell me about a time you had to learn something fast.
> At first I had to quickly understand a complex technician workflow management system built on Django. I dove into the codebase, read documentation, and paired with teammates for a few days to get context.

How do you approach solving tough problems?
> I break them down into smaller parts and try to isolate the root cause by gathering data — logs, error reports, and user feedback.

What do you do when you’re stuck?
> I take a step back to clarify the problem and revisit assumptions. I usually try to reproduce the issue in a minimal environment.

How would you approach learning a totally new codebase?
> I’d start by reading the high-level architecture documents if available, then explore the main modules to understand data flow and core components. I’d look at tests and API endpoints to get practical insight. Running the app locally and debugging simple features helps me see how everything fits together. I’d also reach out to teammates for context and best practices.

How would you handle joining a project midway?
> I’d begin by understanding the project goals, current status, and roadmap. Reviewing documentation, code, and previous discussions is key. I’d ask for an onboarding plan or list of priorities from the team lead or product manager. Early on, I’d focus on smaller tasks or bug fixes to get comfortable and build trust before tackling bigger features.

If your teammate pushed buggy code and it broke something, how would you react?
> I’d review the changes to understand what caused the bug and either fix it myself or collaborate with the teammate. After resolving it, I’d suggest improvements to our testing or review process to prevent similar problems in the future—always keeping the tone constructive and supportive.

You have a tight deadline and a blocker — what’s your move?
> I’d immediately communicate the blocker to my team and product manager, explaining the impact on the timeline. Then I’d try to find a workaround or escalate to someone who can unblock me faster. If necessary, I’d propose a temporary solution or a reduced scope to meet the deadline, while planning to address the blocker fully after.

8. Work Ethic, Pressure & Productivity

How do you handle deadlines or pressure?
> I handle pressure by staying organized and breaking work into smaller, manageable tasks with mini-deadlines. When a deadline approaches, I focus on the highest-impact parts first and avoid getting distracted by less critical details. If things get tight, I communicate early and suggest realistic alternatives or trade-offs.

Remote work might cause stress and burn out sometimes. How do you handle that?
> I’ve experienced this and learned that structure and balance are key. I follow a set daily routine, block off time for deep work, and take breaks just like I would in an office. I also stay connected with my team through async updates and quick calls when needed, which keeps me aligned and supported. 

How do you prioritize your work?
> I use a mix of impact and urgency to prioritize. I usually ask: What unblocks others? What moves the product forward? What’s time-sensitive? I use tools like task boards or Notion to visualize my priorities, and I reevaluate them regularly, especially if something changes. I also proactively communicate with my team or product lead to confirm alignment on what matters most.

9. Technical Experience & Tools

Do you have frontend experience?
> I've been working on backend development and specializing in it, but I’ve worked with Angular, and React Native to build user interfaces, mostly for internal dashboards and admin panels.

Do you write tests?
> Absolutely. I write unit tests using pytest and for Django APIs, I write integration tests with APITestCase or pytest-django. I follow TDD occasionally when building critical business logic.

How do you write scalable APIs?
> Use pagination, filtering, and query optimization. Normalize DB queries and avoid N+1 issues. Use background tasks for non-blocking work (emails, heavy computation). Modularize code and use versioning. Caching where needed (Redis). Rate limiting and API gateways for traffic control.

Do you have experience with background tasks / queues?
> Yes, I’ve used Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ for tasks like sending emails, processing files, and syncing external APIs.

Have you worked with Docker, Kubernetes, or containerization?
> I use Docker daily for local dev and production builds. I’ve written Dockerfiles, docker-compose setups, and created custom images. For Kubernetes: “I have basic knowledge of deploying services.

What’s your familiarity with caching (e.g., Redis)?
> Redis for in-memory caching, rate limiting, storing sessions, or pub/sub.

What’s your favorite design pattern and why?
> Factory Pattern: Good for object creation. Strategy Pattern: Great for swapping algorithms (e.g., payment gateways). Observer Pattern: Good for notifications, event-driven systems.

Describe a monolith-to-microservices migration (or vice versa).
>     Start by extracting low-risk services (e.g., auth, email). Define clear contracts between services (REST, gRPC). Use shared libraries for core logic if needed. Monitor latency, and ensure observability. Vice versa (microservices to monolith): Consolidate to reduce complexity and deployment overhead.

How would you prepare for a traffic spike?
> Add horizontal scalability (load balancer + replicas). Add caching layer (Redis/CDN). Ensure DB indexing. Use async/background workers. Rate limiting.

What’s your approach to debugging tricky bugs?
> Reproduce locally with test cases. Use logs with proper levels. Use print() or pdb for debugging. Add metrics/logs to isolate the issue in prod. Ask: “What changed recently?”

What’s your process for breaking down a new feature?
> Understand requirements from the user’s POV. Break down into backend + frontend tasks. Plan models, APIs, validations, tests. Document API contracts and flows. Ship MVP first, then iterate.

What’s a technical decision you regret?
> Not writing tests early. Overengineering with microservices too soon.

10. Business & Product Thinking

What’s your experience working in high-growth environments?
> In my recent work, I’ve had to rapidly iterate on business-critical systems where the flow of devices, reporting, and client needs evolve fast. I’ve also supported tight deadlines, shifting priorities, and systems that needed to scale quickly under real operational pressure.

11. Company Change & Role Transition

Why are you leaving your current company?
> I'm grateful for the experience I've gained at my current company — especially the trust they’ve given me to take ownership of core backend systems. But over time, I realized I’m ready for a new challenge where I can grow technically and work more closely with product-minded and fast-moving teams. I'm looking for a place like Energent where I can contribute to something innovative, learn from other strong engineers, and have a broader impact beyond just backend tickets.

12. Company-Specific / Projects

Tell me more about DAF / Code Memo
> DAF: DAF is a lightweight, fully asynchronous framework designed to fill the async gaps in Django. While Django has made strides toward supporting async, key components like the ORM, serializers, and middleware still rely heavily on synchronous behavior, creating bottlenecks. DAF offers a modern, async-first approach by building on Django’s existing infrastructure but enforcing and encouraging true asynchronous behavior. It introduces `AsyncView` and `AsyncAPIView` to handle requests natively with `async def`, provides tools like `await_safe()` for safe ORM access, and utilities like `run_in_background()` for background tasks. It also includes middleware, JSON parsing, structured error responses, and an `AsyncRateThrottle` system. Inspired by how Django REST Framework set a new standard for APIs, DAF aims to be the equivalent for async development in Django.

> Code-Memo: Code-Memo is a developer’s digital second brain — a personal, organized, and ever-growing knowledge base covering everything from Python and Django to algorithms, system design, and interview preparation. Originally built to combat forgetfulness and make review lightning-fast, Code-Memo is now a structured set of notes, cheatsheets, and technical breakdowns. It helps both during deep work and last-minute refreshers before interviews. What's unique is that the content isn't just copied from docs — you're rewriting the official Django documentation by hand inside Code-Memo, turning passive reading into active mastery.

13. Final Questions (Reverse Interview)

Just to understand logistics, for remote hires outside the UAE, do you typically bring people on as full-time or as contractors?
I’d love to understand how [Company Name] is measuring success, especially with enterprise clients or pilot partners.

### Debugging Best Practices

Effective debugging is one of the most important skills for any developer. It involves more than just finding and fixing errors; it requires a systematic approach to understand and resolve issues efficiently. When debugging code, it's important to follow certain best practices:

1. Reproduce the Issue: Ensure you can consistently reproduce the issue. Document the steps, inputs, and environment conditions leading up to the issue.

2. Understand the Code: Thoroughly review the relevant code sections to understand its functionality and logic. Follow the code path to see how data flows and where it might be diverging from the expected behavior.

3. Use Debugging Tools: Use built-in debuggers in the IDE to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code. Inserting logging statements would help too.

4. Isolate the Problem: This can help determine if the issue is with specific code or a broader system problem.

5. Verify with Test Cases: Update unit tests to cover the problematic code. Running tests can help verify that the issue is fixed and that no new issues are introduced.

6. Document the Solution: Once the issue is resolved, document the problem, the solution, and any changes made.

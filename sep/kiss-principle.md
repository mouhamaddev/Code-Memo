### KISS Principle

The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle is a philosophy that promotes simplicity. The idea is that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex. Therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

1. Simplicity: Strive to keep your code and systems as straightforward and uncomplicated as possible. Simple code is easier to read, understand, and maintain.

2. Avoid Over-Engineering: Resist the temptation to add features or complexity that are not necessary for solving the current problem.

3. Readability: Write code that is easy for others (and yourself) to read and understand.

4. Maintainability Simpler codebases are easier to maintain and update. When changes are needed, they can be made more quickly and with less risk of introducing bugs.

NOTE: KISS does not mean avoiding good practices like modularization or proper error handling. It means not adding unnecessary complexity. At the same time, donâ€™t simplify to the point where the code no longer meets the requirements.

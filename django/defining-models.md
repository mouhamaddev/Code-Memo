# Models in Django

A model is a class that represents a table in the database, and each attribute is a field or column of the table. Models are defined in models.py file.

Quick example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```

This model is equivalent to:

```sql
CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
    "id" bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
);
```

Notice how the name of the table is myapp_person, which is automatically generated based on app name and model name, and it can be overridden.
Also, An id field is added automatically, and it can be overridden too.

#### String Representation `__str__`

Override the `__str__` method to provide a human-readable representation of the model instance:

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    # Define fields here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

This method is used in the admin interface and other contexts to display object instances.

#### Special Methods

Other special methods like `__init__`, `save`, and `delete` can be overridden to customize model behavior.
